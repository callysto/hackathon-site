# Using data science to settle an argument

Notes: Hi! Follow along in our hypothetical data science example to get a better understanding of how you can use open data and data science in your everyday.

# Scenario

Hello. 

We need your help to settle an argument. A teacher insists that June has nicer weather than August, so we should change the school calendar so we have June off and start the school year in August. Another teacher says we should keep the school calendar the same.

Can you use data science to solve this argument?

# Find weather data

The first thing we need to do to solve this argument is to find some weather data. We'll use data from **Alberta**, in this case because that's where the teacher is from. We'll also show you how you can get weather data from other places in Canada, or the world.

Historical weather data sets are available from the [World Bank's Climate Change Knowledge Portal](https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data).

We can use an online data science platform called Jupyter notebooks to run code, create visualizations, and write about what we find. To log in to a free server that runs Jupyter notebooks, all you need in order to access it is a Google or Microsoft account. (We'll do this during the hackathon.)
