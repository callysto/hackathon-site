title: '2. Pre-Hackathon: What is Data Science?'
description:
  'The role of data science is to summarize raw data into key points of information. Data science helps us make decisions and also saves us time - there can be millions of data points in a raw data set. It would take a long time to analyze raw data without data science skills!'

<exercise id="2" title="Let's wrangle weather data!">

Below is the code to get weather data from Edmonton from 1901 to 2016. The latitude and longitude of Edmonton are **53.544388** and **-113.490929**, and if we want we can change those to different values in the url to get weather data about another location. 

We're using a code "library" to help us do this. Libraries make programming easier by importing code other people have written. Learn more at [About Python](https://www.python.org/about).

**Hint**: Press the `Run Code` button. Be patient, once it loads you should see a data table that is `[1392 rows x 5 columns]` in size.

**Hint**: want to learn more about [variables](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm)?

<exercise id="3" title="Settling the argument">

Below is the code to get the weather data (same as Step 2), and code to get the average temperature data for the months of June and August. 

Can we solve the argument now?

</codeblock>

**Hint**: Press the `Run Code` button.

*Challenge*: Try modifying the code to the City of Toronto by changing the values for latitute and longitude to **43.651890** and **-79.381706** and running the code again. Who wins?

</exercise>

<exercise id="4" title="But what about rain?">

Ok we've settled the argument, right? Uhmmm temperature is one thing but what about the rain? 

Good point, we should probably look at precipitation using the following code. Does this additional information impact who the winner of the argument is?

**Hint**: Press the `Run Code` button.

*Challenge*: Try modifying the code to the City of Toronto by changing the values for latitute and longitude to **43.651890** and **-79.381706** and running the code again. Who wins?
