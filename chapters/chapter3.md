**Question: How do I handle programming errors?**

A common scenario when programming is having errors come up when running your code. Have a look at this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhL78-xriOc) where Laura, a Callysto data scientist, helps you work through some common errors.


**Question: Where can I find some Python and markdown help?**

Googling your questions as well as looking at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (a website where you can ask questions about programming) will help. We also have [Python and markdown](https://callysto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Callysto-Cheatsheet_12.19.18_web.pdf), and [pandas](https://gist.github.com/misterhay/5957ae9d2a4071a01865749c4111daf3) cheatsheets for common commands.

**Question: How will my hackathon submission be evaluated?**

Your hackathon submission will be evaluated using the following rubric by our expert panel of judges. Top submissions will be awarded prizes.

**Question: I’m working my way through the Curiosity (beginner) challenge and I run a code cell but nothing is happening, what should I do?**

Check out this [gif](https://i.imgur.com/WmBwqFD.mp4) to help you troubleshoot.

If your code cell is running, an asterik `[*]` should appear to the left of the cell and the circle beside `Python 3` in the top right corner of your notebook should be filled. To get your code cell working again, make sure your code cell is selected, then click on the stop (⏹) icon in the tool bar. The filled circle in the top right beside `Python 3` will become an open circle. Next, you'll need to click on the `Run` icon from the toolbar (or `shift+enter` or `control+enter`) to run the code cell again. 

**Question: Do we need to answer all six questions in the Amal challenge template?**

No, you don't need to complete all of the questions in the Amal challenge template. Just complete as many as you can or come up with your own questions to answer.
