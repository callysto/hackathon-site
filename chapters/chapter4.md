<exercise id="3" title="Hackathon Challenge: Amal (Advanced)">

Remember those assessment exercises you did before the hackathon on Python and Data Science? If you assessed as an Amal (Advanced) track participant, then click on the link below to access your challenge template. 

Instructions:

1. Click on your Amal challenge **[TEMPLATE](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/AmalTrack/ChallengeTemplate/challenge-template.ipynb&depth=1)**. 
2. Carefully read the instructions, and modify the text and code in this notebook to answer questions on how humans can sustainably build a new home on Mars. Feel free to come up with answers to your own questions!
3. Get inspired! Have a look at these example hackathon submissions - **[Spotify music](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/AmalTrack/ChallengeExamples/music-example.ipynb&depth=1)** and **[plastics](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/AmalTrack/ChallengeExamples/plastic-example.ipynb&depth=1)**. These examples will give you an idea of what your final hackathon submission should look like.
4. Follow this overview of accessing open data in Python to understand how you can access open data sources for your submission -- [notebook](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/Tutorials/accessing-open-data.ipynb&depth=1) and [video](https://youtu.be/ypYKfcOQPDA?list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&t=41). 
5. Get inspired! Review these accessing open data examples to identify potential data sources for your hackathon submission. You can use these open datasets or find your own: Statistics Canada ([notebooks](http://tinyurl.com/y84e5hvh) and [video](https://youtu.be/MWbkdsVPSls?list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&t=21)); NASA ([notebooks](http://tinyurl.com/y84e5hvh) and [video](https://youtu.be/gbcwDtWBB48?list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&t=18)); and Climate, fruit trees, Gapminder (socioeconomic), Google N-grams and trends ([notebooks](http://tinyurl.com/y84e5hvh) and [video](https://youtu.be/dyTfZNdv8MA?list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&t=13)).
