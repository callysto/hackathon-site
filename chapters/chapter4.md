<exercise id="1" title="Start Here: Tutorials">

Start here as these tutorials will provide you with the foundational programming skills to complete your challenge. 

Clicking the following links will launch you into our Callysto Hub service that requires a Gmail or Outlook account to login. You may have a Google (Gmail) or Microsoft (Live) account through your school, or you can create one for free at [Google Signup](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) or [Microsoft Signup](https://signup.live.com/).

1. (Everyone) Intro to Jupyter and Python series - start with **[part 1](http://tinyurl.com/y4aqn5hr)** or watch the **[videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-j7ku2URmjZ1F3-9jvBuvsf0KcWPsxab)** to get an overview of how the Callysto Hub works.
2. (Everyone) Breaking code and breaking down the code. A big part of data science involves coding. In this activity we learn to take a closer look at Python programming code to understand what the code is doing, and developing resilience to common coding errors and debug them - [notebook](https://bit.ly/3Ar45WQ) and [video](https://youtu.be/bDoaKV_lLJY).
2. (Everyone) Intro to Python and Data Frames - [notebook](http://tinyurl.com/yamdly5o) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJT72nq5Rf0&list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&index=2).
3. (Advanced) Intro to Python Data Structures - [notebook](http://tinyurl.com/yc8nzrbt) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYwVqiVvTLw&list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&index=3).
4. (Advanced) Intro to Data Visualization - [notebook](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/Tutorials/graphing-with-plotly.ipynb&depth=1) and [video](https://youtu.be/jvDHrwOsmjg).

<exercise id="2" title="Hackathon Challenge: Curiosity (Beginner)">

Remember those assessment exercises you did before the hackathon on Python and Data Science? If you assessed as a Curiosity (Beginner) track participant, then click on the link below to access the Curiosity website and challenges.

Instructions:

1. Click on your Curiosity challenge [**TEMPLATE**](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/CuriosityTrack/challenge-0.ipynb&depth=1). This is the first notebook in a series of 7 notebooks. When you complete a notebook, thereâ€™s a link at the bottom that takes you to the next more challenging notebook. You can also visit the [Curiosity website](https://callysto.github.io/curiosity-hackathon/welcome.html) to access the challenges.
2. Carefully read and follow the instructions in each notebook. There are also embedded videos in each notebook to help you.

<exercise id="3" title="Hackathon Challenge: Amal (Advanced)">

Remember those assessment exercises you did before the hackathon on Python and Data Science? If you assessed as an Amal (Advanced) track participant, then click on the link below to access your challenge template. 

Instructions:

1. Click on your Amal challenge **[TEMPLATE](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/AmalTrack/ChallengeTemplate/challenge-template.ipynb&depth=1)**. 
2. Carefully read the instructions, and modify the text and code in this notebook to answer questions on how humans can sustainably build a new home on Mars. Feel free to come up with answers to your own questions!
3. Get inspired! Have a look at these example hackathon submissions - **[Spotify music](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/AmalTrack/ChallengeExamples/music-example.ipynb&depth=1)** and **[plastics](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/AmalTrack/ChallengeExamples/plastic-example.ipynb&depth=1)**. These examples will give you an idea of what your final hackathon submission should look like.
4. Follow this overview of accessing open data in Python to understand how you can access open data sources for your submission -- [notebook](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=SustainabilityOnMars/Tutorials/accessing-open-data.ipynb&depth=1) and [video](https://youtu.be/ypYKfcOQPDA?list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&t=41). 
5. Get inspired! Review these accessing open data examples to identify potential data sources for your hackathon submission. You can use these open datasets or find your own: 
- Statistics Canada ([notebooks](https://hub.callysto.ca/jupyter/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcallysto%2Fhackathon&branch=master&subPath=ColonizingMars/AccessingData/Statistics-Canada-Data&depth=1) and [video](https://youtu.be/MWbkdsVPSls?list=PL-j7ku2URmjbXSQ8mSrqGJ3poGpUD0qaE&t=21));
